Proof of concept `11ty` documentation website for `cubing.js`.

# TODO

## Basics: 

- [x] Basic setup
- [x] Check that 11ty works with js
- [x] Deploy to gh pages 

## Other: 

- [x] Create a navbar
    - [x] get basic navbar generation with nunjucks working
    - [x] style the navbar
    - [x] add other navbar items
- [x] Creating a heading sidebar
    - [x] make a sketchy js script to add h2's
    - [x] get the thing to scroll with me
    - [x] add anchors

- [x] Get basic CSS looks going
- [x] Create flexbox layout

## Actually set the website up
- [x] get images working
- [x] homepage
- [x] page layout
- [x] check that pages work 
- [x] reduce the absurd amount of css in bulma.css

## Refinement

- [ ] Navbar formatting for when you're already on a page/at a heading
- [ ] Make code sections look less rubbish
- [ ] Change px values to be reactive
- [ ] Make width of content section uniform
- [ ] sidebar overhaul
    - [ ] add h3's as children of h2's 
    - [ ] change position: fixed to sticky and troubleshoot

## Troubleshooting

- [x] Figure out why CSS isn't being applied to non-index pages
